### Build System:

### Language(s):
C/C++

### Homebrew Requirements:

```
brew install openal-soft sdl2 sdl2_mixer glew python3 imagemagick
pip3 install cogapp generate-iconset
```
### Data situation
Asks for data location on first run

### Notes:
So this one requires both the `brew` items and some Python plugins via the `pip3` command. 

Also I just tried it on my new M1 Max MBP and the mouse look is broken or something. Not what I experienced on my M1 mini. I'll update later and see if it still happens.
