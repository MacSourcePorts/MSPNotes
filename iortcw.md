#
### Build System: 
Make

### Language(s):
C/C++

### Homebrew Requirements:

None. Only thing it needs is SDL2 and it comes with it. 

### Data situation
Data goes in `~/Library/Application Support/RTCW/`

### Notes:
Similar to [ioquake3](ioquake3.md) (in fact technically this source port is ioquake3 with the RTCW changes grafted in) this one is straightforward and the only library it needs comes with it. I did have to copy over the same new library for libSDL2 from ioquake3.
