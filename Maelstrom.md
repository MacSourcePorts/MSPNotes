### Why is Mac Source Ports doing a build of this port?
It was a request. The original does sign and notarize but only for Intel.

### Versioning/Release strategy:
The code is versioned but very infrequent. So the latest code only.

### Build System: 
Make

### Language(s):
C/C++

### Homebrew Requirements:

```
brew install sdl2
```
### Data situation
Comes with the data

### Notes:
This is probably the easiest port to do. And one of the most popular/requested ones. 

### MSP Fork differences:
Too many to name, plus this isn't from GitHub and the source rarely changes. This one will probably remain an MSP fork
